The code in this file is responsible for checking that the `dataclass` module has been imported if there are any class definitions in the code. It achieves this by implementing two classes: `RewriteLocation` and `RewriteImport`.

`RewriteLocation` is a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer` and is responsible for copying the location of a node to another node. It takes an `orig_node` parameter in its constructor and sets it as an instance variable. When the `visit` method is called on a node, it copies the location of `orig_node` to the node and returns the result of calling the `visit` method of its superclass.

`RewriteImport` is also a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer` and is responsible for resolving imports. It takes two optional parameters in its constructor: `filename` and `package`. When the `visit_ImportFrom` method is called on an `ImportFrom` node, it checks if the module being imported is one of `pycardano`, `typing`, `dataclasses`, or `hashlib`. If it is, it returns the node unchanged. Otherwise, it checks that the import statement has the form `from <pkg> import *` and imports the module using the `import_module` function defined earlier in the file. It then reads the contents of the module and parses it using the `parse` function from the `ast` module. It then uses `RewriteLocation` to copy the location of the original `ImportFrom` node to the parsed module and recursively resolves all imports in the module using another instance of `RewriteImport`.

Overall, this code is used to ensure that the `dataclass` module is imported if there are any class definitions in the code. It does this by recursively resolving all imports in the code and checking if the `dataclass` module is imported. If it is not, it raises an error. This code is likely used as part of a larger project that relies on the `dataclass` module and needs to ensure that it is always imported when needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RewriteLocation` class?
- The `RewriteLocation` class is used to copy the location of the original node to the new node during AST transformation.

2. What is the purpose of the `RewriteImport` class?
- The `RewriteImport` class is used to recursively resolve imports in a Python file and return the transformed AST.

3. What is the purpose of the `import_module` function?
- The `import_module` function is an approximate implementation of the `import` statement in Python and is used to import a module by name and package.
