The code in this file is responsible for injecting constructors for the built-in types that double function as type annotations. This is achieved through the use of the `CompilingNodeTransformer` class from the `util` module, which is inherited by the `RewriteInjectBuiltinsConstr` class defined in this file. 

The `RewriteInjectBuiltinsConstr` class defines a `visit_Module` method that takes a `TypedModule` node as input and returns a modified `TypedModule` node. The method first creates a list of additional assignments that will be added to the module body. For each of the built-in types `bytes`, `int`, `str`, and `bool`, the method creates a new type object by calling the `constr_type` method on the type object and then creates a new `TypedAssign` node that assigns a lambda function to the type name. The lambda function takes a single argument `_` and returns the result of calling the `constr` method on the type object. 

The `constr` method is defined on each of the built-in type objects and returns a new instance of the type. The lambda function assigned to each type name effectively creates a constructor function for the type that can be used as a type annotation. 

Finally, the `visit_Module` method creates a copy of the input node, prepends the list of additional assignments to the module body, and returns the modified node. 

Overall, this code is used to add constructor functions for the built-in types that can be used as type annotations in the larger project. For example, the following code snippet demonstrates how the `int` constructor can be used as a type annotation:

```
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code injects constructors for the built-in types that double function as type annotations.

2. What is the `CompilingNodeTransformer` class and how is it used in this code?
    
    `CompilingNodeTransformer` is a class that is used to transform AST nodes during the compilation process. In this code, it is subclassed to create a custom transformer that injects constructors for built-in types.

3. What types are being injected and how are they being constructed?
    
    The types being injected are `ByteStringType`, `IntegerType`, `StringType`, and `BoolType`. They are being constructed using the `constr_type()` method and a lambda function that takes a single argument and returns the type.
