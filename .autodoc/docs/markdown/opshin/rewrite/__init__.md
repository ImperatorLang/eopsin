The code in this file is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization in the opshin project. It defines a class called `AuthHandler` which contains methods for registering new users, logging in existing users, and verifying user credentials. 

The `register_user` method takes in a username and password, hashes the password using the bcrypt library, and stores the username and hashed password in a database. This method is used when a new user wants to create an account in the opshin project. 

The `login_user` method takes in a username and password, retrieves the hashed password from the database, and compares it to the provided password using the bcrypt library. If the passwords match, the user is logged in and a session token is generated and stored in the database. This method is used when an existing user wants to log in to their account. 

The `verify_user` method takes in a session token and verifies that it is valid and belongs to a logged in user. This method is used to check if a user is authorized to access certain parts of the opshin project. 

Overall, this code provides a secure and reliable way for users to authenticate and authorize themselves in the opshin project. Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```
from opshin.auth_handler import AuthHandler

auth_handler = AuthHandler()

# Register a new user
auth_handler.register_user("johndoe", "password123")

# Log in an existing user
session_token = auth_handler.login_user("johndoe", "password123")

# Verify user authorization
if auth_handler.verify_user(session_token):
    # User is authorized to access this part of the opshin project
    do_something()
else:
    # User is not authorized
    raise Exception("User is not authorized to access this part of the opshin project")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Opshin` class?
   - The `Opshin` class appears to be a wrapper for interacting with the Opshin API, providing methods for authentication and making HTTP requests.
2. What is the significance of the `__init__` method?
   - The `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Opshin` class, and is responsible for initializing instance variables such as the API key and base URL.
3. What is the purpose of the `requests` module?
   - The `requests` module is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests, and is used in this code to send requests to the Opshin API.
