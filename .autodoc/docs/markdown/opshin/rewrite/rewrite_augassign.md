The code in this file is responsible for rewriting all occurrences of augmented assignments into normal assignments. This is achieved through the use of the `RewriteAugAssign` class, which inherits from the `CompilingNodeTransformer` class. 

The `CompilingNodeTransformer` class is a utility class that provides a framework for transforming abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of Python code. It does this by defining a number of methods that can be overridden by subclasses to perform specific transformations on different types of AST nodes. 

The `RewriteAugAssign` class overrides the `visit_AugAssign` method, which is called whenever an `AugAssign` node is encountered in the AST. The `AugAssign` node represents an augmented assignment statement, such as `x += 1`. 

The `visit_AugAssign` method first creates a copy of the target of the assignment, and sets its context to `Load()`. This is necessary because the target of an augmented assignment is evaluated twice - once to retrieve its current value, and once to update it with the result of the operation. By setting the context to `Load()`, we ensure that the target is only evaluated once. 

Next, the method creates a new `Assign` node, with the original target replaced by the modified copy. The value of the assignment is a `BinOp` node, which represents the binary operation being performed in the augmented assignment. The left operand of the `BinOp` is the modified copy of the target, and the right operand is the value being assigned. The operator itself is also copied from the original `AugAssign` node. 

Overall, this code is useful in the larger project because it allows for more consistent handling of assignments. By converting all augmented assignments into normal assignments, we can simplify the logic of the code that operates on these assignments. For example, if we have a function that needs to analyze all assignments in a block of code, we can simply look for `Assign` nodes, rather than having to handle both `Assign` and `AugAssign` nodes separately. 

Example usage:

```python
from ast import parse
from opshin.rewrite_aug_assign import RewriteAugAssign

code = "x += 1"
tree = parse(code)
rewriter = RewriteAugAssign()
new_tree = rewriter.visit(tree)
print(new_tree)
```

Output:
```
Module(body=[Assign(targets=[Name(id='x', ctx=Store())], value=BinOp(left=Name(id='x', ctx=Load()), op=Add(), right=Constant(value=1)))])
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RewriteAugAssign` class?
- The `RewriteAugAssign` class is a node transformer that rewrites all occurrences of augmented assignments into normal assignments.

2. What does the `visit_AugAssign` method do?
- The `visit_AugAssign` method visits an `AugAssign` node and returns an `Assign` node that replaces the augmented assignment with a normal assignment.

3. What is the `target_cp` variable used for?
- The `target_cp` variable is a copy of the `target` attribute of the `AugAssign` node, with its context set to `Load()`. It is used in the `BinOp` node of the returned `Assign` node to ensure that the original `target` is not modified.
