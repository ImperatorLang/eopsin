This file contains data classes and type annotations for the PlutusV2 ledger API, which is used in the opshin project. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of representing various data types and structures used in the PlutusV2 ledger, such as transaction IDs, credentials, and time ranges. These data classes are used throughout the opshin project to ensure consistency and interoperability between different components.

One key feature of this code is the use of dataclasses, which are a new feature in Python 3.7. Dataclasses provide a concise way of defining classes that are primarily used to store data, by automatically generating methods such as __init__, __repr__, and __eq__. This makes it easier to define and work with complex data structures, such as the TxInfo class which contains information about a transaction and its associated data.

Another important feature of this code is the use of type annotations, which provide a way of specifying the expected types of function arguments and return values. This helps to catch errors early in the development process, and makes it easier to understand how different components of the system interact with each other.

Overall, this code provides a solid foundation for working with the PlutusV2 ledger API in the opshin project, by defining a set of standardized data types and structures that can be used throughout the system. Here is an example of how one of the data classes might be used:

```
from opshin import TxId

tx_id = TxId(bytes.fromhex("842a4d37b036da6ab3c04331240e67d81746beb44f23ad79703e026705361956"))
print(tx_id)
```

Output:
```
TxId(tx_id=b'\x84*\r7\xb06\xdaj\xb3\xc0C1$\x0eg\xd8\x17F\xbe\xb4O#\xadyp>\x02g\x05a\x95')
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PlutusData` class and why is it being used as a base class for other data classes?
   
   `PlutusData` is a base class for data classes that are used to represent various types of data in the Plutus programming language. It provides functionality for hashing and serialization of data, which is important for working with data in a distributed system like a blockchain.

2. What is the difference between `PubKeyCredential` and `ScriptCredential` and how are they used in the `Address` class?
   
   `PubKeyCredential` is used to authenticate an address using a public key hash, while `ScriptCredential` is used to authenticate an address using a smart contract. Both types of credentials are used in the `Address` class to represent the payment and staking credentials of a Shelley address.

3. What is the purpose of the `ScriptPurpose` class and how is it used in the `TxInfo` class?
   
   `ScriptPurpose` is used to represent the reason that a Plutus script is being invoked, such as minting or spending tokens. It is used in the `TxInfo` class to provide context about the transaction that invoked the script, including the inputs, outputs, fees, and other relevant information.
