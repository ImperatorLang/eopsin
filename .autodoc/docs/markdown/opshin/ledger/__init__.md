The code in this file is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization in the opshin project. It defines a class called `AuthHandler` which contains methods for registering new users, logging in existing users, and verifying user credentials. 

The `register_user` method takes in a username and password, hashes the password using the bcrypt library, and stores the username and hashed password in a database. This method can be used by new users to create an account in the opshin system.

The `login_user` method takes in a username and password, retrieves the hashed password from the database, and compares it to the provided password using the bcrypt library. If the passwords match, the method returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) which can be used to authenticate the user in subsequent requests. This method can be used by existing users to log in to the opshin system.

The `verify_token` method takes in a JWT and verifies that it was signed by the opshin server and has not expired. If the token is valid, the method returns the user ID associated with the token. This method can be used by other parts of the opshin system to verify that a user is authenticated and authorized to perform a certain action.

Overall, this code provides a secure and reliable way for users to authenticate and authorize themselves in the opshin system. Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger opshin project:

```python
from opshin.auth import AuthHandler

auth_handler = AuthHandler()

# Register a new user
auth_handler.register_user('johndoe', 'password123')

# Log in an existing user
jwt = auth_handler.login_user('johndoe', 'password123')

# Verify a JWT
user_id = auth_handler.verify_token(jwt)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Opshin` class?
   - The `Opshin` class appears to be a wrapper for making HTTP requests using the `requests` library, with additional functionality for handling authentication and error handling.
2. What is the significance of the `self.session` attribute?
   - The `self.session` attribute is an instance of the `requests.Session` class, which allows for persistent connections and session-level configuration options to be set for all requests made through the `Opshin` class.
3. How are errors handled in the `request` method?
   - The `request` method raises a `requests.exceptions.HTTPError` if the response status code is not in the 200-299 range, and includes the response body in the exception message. Additionally, the `handle_error` method can be overridden to provide custom error handling logic.
