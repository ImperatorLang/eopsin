The code defines several functions for comparing and manipulating time intervals in the opshin project. The `compare` function takes two integer arguments and returns 1 if the first argument is less than the second, 0 if they are equal, and -1 if the first argument is greater than the second. 

The `compare_extended_helper` function takes an argument of type `ExtendedPOSIXTime` and returns -1 if the argument is an instance of `NegInfPOSIXTime`, 0 if it is an instance of `FinitePOSIXTime`, and 1 if it is an instance of `PosInfPOSIXTime`. 

The `compare_extended` function takes two arguments of type `ExtendedPOSIXTime` and returns the result of comparing them using the `compare_extended_helper` function. If both arguments are instances of `FinitePOSIXTime`, it compares their underlying time values using the `compare` function. Otherwise, it compares the results of `compare_extended_helper` for each argument. 

The `get_bool` function takes an argument of type `BoolData` and returns `True` if the argument is an instance of `TrueData`, and `False` otherwise. 

The `compare_upper_bound` and `compare_lower_bound` functions take two arguments of type `UpperBoundPOSIXTime` and `LowerBoundPOSIXTime`, respectively, and compare their limits using the `compare_extended` function. If the limits are equal, it compares the values of their `closed` attributes using the `get_bool` and `compare` functions. 

The `contains` function takes two arguments of type `POSIXTimeRange` and returns `True` if the second argument is entirely contained within the first argument. It does this by comparing the lower and upper bounds of each interval using the `compare_lower_bound` and `compare_upper_bound` functions. 

Finally, the `make_range`, `make_from`, and `make_to` functions create instances of `POSIXTimeRange` with the given bounds. `make_range` takes two arguments of type `POSIXTime` and returns a range from the lower bound to the upper bound, inclusive. `make_from` takes a single argument of type `POSIXTime` and returns a range from the given time to infinity. `make_to` takes a single argument of type `POSIXTime` and returns a range from negative infinity to the given time. 

These functions provide a set of tools for working with time intervals in the opshin project, allowing for comparisons and manipulations of ranges of time values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `compare` function?
- The `compare` function takes in two integers and returns an integer indicating whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer.

2. What is the purpose of the `contains` function?
- The `contains` function takes in two `POSIXTimeRange` objects and returns a boolean indicating whether the second range is entirely contained within the first range.

3. What is the purpose of the `make_from` function?
- The `make_from` function creates a `POSIXTimeRange` object with a lower bound at the given time and an upper bound at positive infinity, including the given time.
