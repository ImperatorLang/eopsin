The code in this file is responsible for handling user authentication and authorization within the opshin project. It provides a set of functions and classes that can be used to manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.

At a high level, the code works by defining a set of roles that users can be assigned to, such as "admin" or "user". Each role has a set of permissions associated with it, such as "create", "read", "update", and "delete". Users can be assigned one or more roles, and their permissions are determined by the combination of roles they have.

The main class in this file is called `AuthManager`, which provides methods for managing user accounts, roles, and permissions. For example, the `create_user` method can be used to create a new user account, while the `assign_role` method can be used to assign a role to a user.

Here's an example of how this code might be used in the larger opshin project:

```python
from opshin.auth import AuthManager

# Create an instance of the AuthManager class
auth_manager = AuthManager()

# Create a new user account
auth_manager.create_user(username='jdoe', password='password123')

# Assign the "admin" role to the user
auth_manager.assign_role(username='jdoe', role='admin')

# Check if the user has permission to create a new resource
if auth_manager.check_permission(username='jdoe', permission='create'):
    # Allow the user to create the resource
    create_resource()
else:
    # Deny the user permission to create the resource
    raise PermissionError('User does not have permission to create a resource')
```

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to manage user authentication and authorization within the opshin project. By defining roles and permissions, it allows developers to easily control what actions users are allowed to perform within the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Opshin` class?
   - The `Opshin` class appears to be a wrapper for making HTTP requests using the `requests` library. It includes methods for making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
2. What is the purpose of the `__init__` method?
   - The `__init__` method initializes the `Opshin` class with a base URL and optional headers and authentication credentials. These values are used in subsequent requests made with the class.
3. What is the purpose of the `handle_response` method?
   - The `handle_response` method checks the status code of the HTTP response and raises an exception if it is not in the 200-299 range. It also returns the JSON content of the response if it exists. This method is used to handle errors and parse response data in a consistent way throughout the class.
