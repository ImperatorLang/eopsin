This code is responsible for converting input data from standard input into a JSON object that can be used as a Smart Contract in the opshin project. 

The code first imports the necessary modules, including `json`, `stdin` from `sys`, and `cbor2`. `json` is used to convert the final output into a JSON object, `stdin` is used to read input data from standard input, and `cbor2` is used to encode the input data into a CBOR format. 

Next, the code reads the input data from standard input using `stdin.buffer.read()` and encodes it into a CBOR format using `cbor2.dumps()`. The resulting CBOR data is then converted to a hexadecimal string using the `hex()` method. 

Finally, the code creates a dictionary object `d` that contains the necessary information for the Smart Contract, including the type of contract (`PlutusScriptV2`), a description that includes the version of the opshin project (`opshin {__version__} Smart Contract`), and the CBOR data in hexadecimal format. The dictionary is then converted to a JSON object using `json.dumps()` and printed to standard output. 

This code can be used as a building block for creating Smart Contracts in the opshin project. By providing input data through standard input, the code can encode the data into a format that can be used as a Smart Contract. The resulting JSON object can then be used in other parts of the project to execute the Smart Contract. 

Example usage:

```
$ echo "hello world" | python contract_builder.py
{"type": "PlutusScriptV2", "description": "opshin 1.0.0 Smart Contract", "cborHex": "430a68656c6c6f20776f726c64"}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code takes input from standard input, converts it to CBOR format, and then creates a JSON object with metadata about the CBOR data.

2. What is the significance of the "PlutusScriptV2" type in the JSON object?
   
   The "PlutusScriptV2" type indicates that the CBOR data is a Plutus smart contract script, which is used in the Cardano blockchain.

3. What is the purpose of the opshin version number in the JSON object description?
   
   The opshin version number is included in the JSON object description to provide information about the version of the opshin software that was used to create the smart contract. This can be useful for debugging and tracking changes over time.
