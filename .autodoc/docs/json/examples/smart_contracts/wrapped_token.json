  "summary": "The code defines a smart contract for a wrapped token. The contract is parameterized with the token policy ID, token name, and wrapping factor. The purpose of the contract is to wrap a token by adding decimal places to it. The contract has two purposes: minting and spending. When tokens are minted or burned, the minting purpose is triggered. When tokens are unlocked from the contract, the spending purpose is triggered. \n\nThe `all_tokens_unlocked_from_contract_address` function calculates the total number of tokens that have been unlocked from the contract address. It takes a list of transaction inputs, an address, and a token as input, and returns the total number of tokens that have been unlocked.\n\nThe `own_spent_utxo` function obtains the resolved transaction output that is going to be spent from this contract address. It takes a list of transaction inputs and a spending object as input, and returns the transaction output.\n\nThe `own_policy_id` function obtains the policy ID for which this contract can validate minting/burning. It takes a transaction output as input and returns the policy ID.\n\nThe `own_address` function returns the address of the contract. It takes a policy ID as input and returns an address.\n\nThe `all_tokens_locked_at_contract_address` function calculates the total number of tokens that are locked at the contract address. It takes a list of transaction outputs, an address, and a token as input, and returns the total number of tokens that are locked.\n\nThe `validator` function is the main function of the contract. It takes the token policy ID, token name, wrapping factor, datum, redeemer, and context as input. The function checks the purpose of the context and obtains the address and policy ID of the contract. It then calculates the total number of tokens that are locked, unlocked, and minted. Finally, it checks that the correct amount of tokens has been minted and prints the results.\n\nAn example of how to use this contract is by calling the `validator` function with the appropriate parameters. For instance, to wrap a token with policy ID `ae810731b5d21c0d182d89c60a1eff7095dffd1c0dce8707a8611099`, token name `4d494c4b`, and wrapping factor `1000000`, the following command can be used:\n\n```\nopshin build examples/smart_contracts/wrapped_token.py '{\"bytes\": \"ae810731b5d21c0d182d89c60a1eff7095dffd1c0dce8707a8611099\"}' '{\"bytes\": \"4d494c4b\"}' '{\"int\": 1000000}' --force-three-params\n```\n\nOverall, this code defines a smart contract for wrapping a token by adding decimal places to it. The contract has two purposes: minting and spending, and it checks that the correct amount of tokens has been minted.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Empty` class?\n- The `Empty` class is a subclass of `PlutusData` and does not have any attributes or methods. It is likely used as a placeholder or marker for certain operations.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `validator` function?\n- The `validator` function is a parameterized contract that takes in three arguments controlling which token is to be wrapped and how many decimal places to add. It is used to validate minting/burning of tokens and enforce correct wrapping factor.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `all_tokens_locked_at_contract_address` function?\n- The `all_tokens_locked_at_contract_address` function takes in a list of transaction outputs, an address, and a token, and returns the total amount of tokens locked at the given address for the given token. It enforces a small inlined datum for each script output."
