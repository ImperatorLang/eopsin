  "summary": "The code is a module that prevents certain variable names from being overwritten in a Python program. It does this by defining a set of forbidden names and then using a custom AST transformer to check if any of these names are being assigned new values. If a forbidden name is found to be overwritten, a custom exception is raised.\n\nThe module is designed to be used as part of a larger project, where it is important to ensure that certain names are not accidentally overwritten. This could be particularly useful in projects that make use of type annotations or custom decorators, where overwriting certain names could cause unexpected behavior.\n\nTo use the module, simply import it and call the `RewriteForbiddenOverwrites` class with the AST of the code you want to check. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom opshin.forbidden_overwrites import RewriteForbiddenOverwrites\nimport ast\n\ncode = \"\"\"\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nList = \"this should raise an error\"\n\"\"\"\n\ntree = ast.parse(code)\ntransformer = RewriteForbiddenOverwrites()\ntransformer.visit(tree)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `RewriteForbiddenOverwrites` transformer is used to check the AST of some Python code. The code defines a list called `my_list` and then tries to assign a string to the `List` variable, which is one of the forbidden names. When the transformer visits this node in the AST, it raises a `ForbiddenOverwriteError` exception, preventing the code from executing further.\n\nOverall, this module provides a simple but effective way to prevent certain names from being overwritten in a Python program, helping to ensure that the program behaves as expected.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is meant to prevent certain variable names from being overwritten.\n\n2. What are the forbidden variable names?\n- The forbidden variable names include \"List\", \"Dict\", \"Union\", \"dataclass\", and \"PlutusData\".\n\n3. What happens if a forbidden variable name is overwritten?\n- If a forbidden variable name is overwritten, a ForbiddenOverwriteError will be raised with a message indicating that it is not allowed to overwrite that name."
