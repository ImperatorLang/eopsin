  "summary": "The `RewriteImportPlutusData` class is responsible for checking that there was an import of `dataclass` if there are any class definitions. This is important because `dataclass` is required for defining classes that inherit from `PlutusData`. \n\nThe class inherits from `CompilingNodeTransformer`, which is a utility class that traverses the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a Python program and applies transformations to it. \n\nThe `visit_ImportFrom` method checks that the program contains one specific import statement: `from pycardano import Datum as Anything, PlutusData`. If this import statement is not present or is not in the correct format, an assertion error is raised. If the import statement is correct, the `imports_plutus_data` attribute of the class is set to `True`. \n\nThe `visit_ClassDef` method checks that each class definition in the program meets certain requirements. Specifically, it checks that the class has no decorators except for `@dataclass`, inherits only from `PlutusData`, and that `PlutusData` is imported in order to use datum classes. If any of these requirements are not met, an assertion error is raised. \n\nOverall, this code ensures that the necessary imports and class definitions are present in a Python program in order to use datum classes. It is likely used as part of a larger project that involves working with PlutusData and Datum objects. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom opshin import RewriteImportPlutusData\n\n# create an instance of the class\ntransformer = RewriteImportPlutusData()\n\n# apply the transformation to the AST of a Python program\nnew_ast = transformer.visit(old_ast)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RewriteImportPlutusData` class?\n    \n    The `RewriteImportPlutusData` class checks that there was an import of dataclass if there are any class definitions.\n\n2. What does the `visit_ImportFrom` method do?\n    \n    The `visit_ImportFrom` method checks that the program contains one 'from pycardano import Datum as Anything, PlutusData' and sets the `imports_plutus_data` attribute to True.\n\n3. What does the `visit_ClassDef` method do?\n    \n    The `visit_ClassDef` method checks that class definitions have no decorators but @dataclass, inherit only from PlutusData, and PlutusData must be imported in order to use datum classes."
