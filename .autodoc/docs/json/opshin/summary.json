      "summary": "The `opshin` module provides a command-line interface for compiling and evaluating Python programs into UPLC (Unspent Transaction Output Payable Contract) code. The module imports several other modules, including `argparse`, `enum`, `importlib`, `json`, `pathlib`, `sys`, `typing`, and `ast`. The `Command` class is an enumeration of the available commands, including `compile_pluto`, `compile`, `eval`, `parse`, `eval_uplc`, and `build`. The `plutus_data_from_json` function converts JSON data into Plutus data, which is a type of data used in the Cardano blockchain. The `main` function parses command-line arguments, reads the input file, and executes the specified command. \n\nThe `compile_pluto` command compiles the input file into Plutus code and prints the result. The `compile` command compiles the input file into UPLC code and prints the result. The `eval` command evaluates the input file with the specified arguments and prints the result. The `parse` command parses the input file and prints a success message. The `eval_uplc` command evaluates the input file as UPLC code and prints the result. The `build` command compiles the input file into UPLC code, generates several artifacts, and writes them to the specified output directory. \n\nThe `opshin` module is used in the larger project to provide a convenient way to compile and evaluate Python programs as UPLC code. This is useful for developers who want to write smart contracts for the Cardano blockchain in Python, which is a more familiar language for many developers than the low-level UPLC language. The `opshin` module provides a high-level interface for compiling and evaluating Python programs as UPLC code, which makes it easier for developers to write smart contracts for the Cardano blockchain. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ python opshin.py eval my_contract.py 42 \"hello world\"\nStarting execution\n------------------\nHello, world! The answer is 42.\n------------------\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Command` enum and how is it used in the code?\n- The `Command` enum is used to define the different commands that can be executed on the input file, such as `compile`, `eval`, and `build`. It is used to validate the user's input and determine which command to execute.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `plutus_data_from_json` function and when is it called?\n- The `plutus_data_from_json` function is used to convert JSON data into Plutus data types, such as `int` and `bytes`. It is called when parsing input parameters for the `eval` command.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `build` command and what artifacts does it generate?\n- The `build` command is used to generate artifacts for a compiled contract, such as the CBOR-encoded script, the Plutus JSON representation, the policy ID, and the mainnet and testnet addresses.

It does so by implementing a series of transformations and optimizations on the input AST, ultimately producing a compiled program that can be executed in the UPLC/Pluto environment.\n\nThe main class in this file is `UPLCCompiler`, which inherits from `CompilingNodeTransformer`. This class defines methods for visiting and transforming various types of AST nodes, such as `visit_BinOp`, `visit_BoolOp`, `visit_UnaryOp`, and so on. These methods are responsible for converting the input Python code into the corresponding UPLC/Pluto code.\n\nThe `compile` function is the main entry point for this module. It takes an input AST and applies a series of rewrite steps and optimizations to simplify and improve the code. Some of these steps include:\n\n- Rewriting imports, such as `RewriteImport`, `RewriteImportPlutusData`, `RewriteImportHashlib`, and `RewriteImportTyping`.\n- Simplifying Python code, such as `RewriteSubscript38`, `RewriteAugAssign`, and `RewriteTupleAssign`.\n- Type inference, using the `AggressiveTypeInferencer` class.\n- Applying optimizations, such as `OptimizeRemoveDeadvars`, `OptimizeVarlen`, `OptimizeRemoveDeadconstants`, and `OptimizeRemovePass`.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the `UPLCCompiler` is used to compile the resulting AST into UPLC/Pluto code.\n\nHere's an example of how the `compile` function might be used:\n\n```python\nfrom ast import parse\nfrom opshin import compile\n\nsource_code = \"\"\"\ndef validator(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a + b\n\"\"\"\n\nast_tree = parse(source_code)\ncompiled_program = compile(ast_tree, force_three_params=False, validator_function_name=\"validator\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `compile` function takes the AST of a simple Python function and compiles it into UPLC/Pluto code.",
      "questions": "1. **What operations are supported by the `BinOpMap`?**\n\n   The `BinOpMap` supports the following operations: Add, Sub, Mult, FloorDiv, Mod, and Pow. These operations are defined for specific combinations of types such as IntegerInstanceType, ByteStringInstanceType, and StringInstanceType.\n\n2. **How does the `UPLCCompiler` handle the compilation of `If` statements?**\n\n   The `UPLCCompiler` compiles `If` statements by creating a lambda function that takes the state monad as an argument and returns an expression using the `Ite` (if-then-else) function. The `Ite` function takes the compiled test condition, the compiled body of the `If` statement, and the compiled `orelse` part of the `If` statement.\n\n3. **What types of subscript operations are supported by the `visit_Subscript` method?**\n\n   The `visit_Subscript` method supports subscript operations for TupleType, PairType, ListType, DictType, and ByteStringType. It handles constant index access for tuples and pairs, single element list index access, key access for dictionaries, and slicing for byte strings."

The `Token` class represents a token, which is identified by a policy ID and a token name. The `all_tokens_unlocked_from_address` function takes a list of transaction inputs (`txins`), an address, and a token, and returns the number of tokens of the specified type that are unlocked from the given address. The `all_tokens_locked_at_address_with_datum` function takes a list of transaction outputs (`txouts`), an address, a token, and an output datum, and returns the number of tokens of the specified type that are locked at the given address with the specified datum. The `all_tokens_locked_at_address` function takes a list of transaction outputs (`txouts`), an address, and a token, and returns the number of tokens of the specified type that are locked at the given address. \n\nThe `resolve_spent_utxo` function takes a list of transaction inputs (`txins`) and a `Spending` object, and returns the UTxO (unspent transaction output) whose spending should be validated. The `resolve_datum_unsafe` function takes a transaction output (`txout`) and a `TxInfo` object, and returns the datum attached to the given transaction output, independent of whether it was inlined or embedded. If no datum was attached, an exception is raised. The `resolve_datum` function takes a transaction output (`txout`) and a `TxInfo` object, and returns a `SomeOutputDatum` object with the datum attached to the given transaction output, if there was an attached datum. Otherwise, it returns a `NoOutputDatum` object.\n\nThese functions are used to handle tokens at addresses in the opshin project. For example, `all_tokens_unlocked_from_address` could be used to check if a user has enough unlocked tokens to perform a transaction, while `all_tokens_locked_at_address_with_datum` could be used to check if a user has enough locked tokens with a specific datum to perform a transaction. The `resolve_spent_utxo` function could be used to validate the spending of a UTxO, while the `resolve_datum_unsafe` and `resolve_datum` functions could be used to retrieve the datum attached to a transaction output. Overall, these functions provide a set of useful tools for working with tokens in the opshin project.",

The purpose of this type inference is to resolve overloaded functions when translating Python into UPLC, where there is no dynamic type checking. Additionally, it provides an extra layer of security for the Smart Contract by checking type correctness.\n\nThe `AggressiveTypeInferencer` class is a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer` and is responsible for performing type inference on the given AST. It maintains a stack of dictionaries called `scopes` to store variable types in different scopes. The class provides methods to enter and exit scopes, set variable types, and infer types from annotations.\n\nThe `visit_*` methods are implemented for various AST nodes, such as `visit_ClassDef`, `visit_FunctionDef`, `visit_Module`, and others. These methods perform type inference on the respective nodes and return typed versions of the nodes (e.g., `TypedClassDef`, `TypedFunctionDef`, etc.).\n\nThe `RecordReader` class is a subclass of `NodeVisitor` and is responsible for extracting information about a class definition, such as its name, constructor, and attributes. It uses the `AggressiveTypeInferencer` to infer types for the attributes.\n\nThe `typed_ast` function takes an AST as input and returns a typed version of the AST by using the `AggressiveTypeInferencer`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom .type_inference import typed_ast\nimport ast\n\nsource_code = \"\"\"\nclass MyClass:\n    CONSTR_ID: int = 1\n    attribute: int\n\"\"\"\n\ntree = ast.parse(source_code)\ntyped_tree = typed_ast(tree)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `typed_ast` function is used to perform type inference on the given source code and return a typed version of the AST.\n\n[1]: https://legacy.python.org/workshops/2000-01/proceedings/papers/aycock/aycock.html",
      "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `AggressiveTypeInferencer` class?\n   **Answer**: The `AggressiveTypeInferencer` class is a type inference system based on the work of Aycock. It is designed to statically infer the type of all involved variables in a subset of legal Python operations, which helps in resolving overloaded functions when translating Python into UPLC where there is no dynamic type checking. It also adds an additional layer of security to the Smart Contract by checking type correctness.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `type_from_annotation` method work?\n   **Answer**: The `type_from_annotation` method takes an annotation expression as input and returns the corresponding type. It supports various types of annotations, such as `Constant`, `Name`, `Subscript`, and `None`. It handles different cases for each type of annotation and raises a `NotImplementedError` if an unsupported annotation type is encountered.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `visit_FunctionDef` method handle function definitions?\n   **Answer**: The `visit_FunctionDef` method processes a function definition by first entering a new scope, visiting the function arguments, and inferring the function type based on the argument types and return type annotation. It then sets the function type in the current scope for potential recursion. After that, it visits the function body, checks if the return type matches the annotated return type, and exits the scope. Finally, it sets the function type outside the scope for usage and returns the typed function definition."

It provides methods for registering new users, logging in existing users, and verifying user credentials using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). For example, to register a new user and log them in, you would use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom opshin.auth import AuthHandler\n\nauth_handler = AuthHandler()\nauth_handler.register_user('johndoe', 'password123')\njwt = auth_handler.login_user('johndoe', 'password123')\n```\n\nThe `api_v2.py` file contains data classes and type annotations for the PlutusV2 ledger API. These data classes, such as `TxId`, provide a standardized way of representing various data types and structures used in the PlutusV2 ledger. They ensure consistency and interoperability between different components of the opshin project. For example, to create a `TxId` object, you would use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom opshin import TxId\n\ntx_id = TxId(bytes.fromhex(\"842a4d37b036da6ab3c04331240e67d81746beb44f23ad79703e026705361956\"))\nprint(tx_id)\n```\n\nThe `interval.py` file defines functions for comparing and manipulating time intervals. These functions, such as `compare`, `compare_extended`, and `contains`, provide a set of tools for working with time intervals in the opshin project. For example, to create a `POSIXTimeRange` object and check if another range is contained within it, you would use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom opshin.interval import make_range, contains\n\nrange1 = make_range(POSIXTime(100), POSIXTime(200))\nrange2 = make_range(POSIXTime(150), POSIXTime(180))\nis_contained = contains(range1, range2)\n```\n\nOverall, the code in this folder provides essential functionality for user authentication, working with the PlutusV2 ledger API, and manipulating time intervals in the opshin project. These components are crucial for ensuring a secure, reliable, and efficient system.",

Roles are defined as a set of permissions, and users can be assigned one or more roles. Permissions are defined as a set of actions that a user is allowed to perform, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data.\n\nThe main class in this file is the `User` class, which represents a user account. It contains properties such as the user's name, email address, and password, as well as methods for managing the user's roles and permissions. For example, the `add_role` method can be used to assign a role to a user, and the `has_permission` method can be used to check if a user has a specific permission.\n\nAnother important class is the `Role` class, which represents a set of permissions. It contains a list of permissions that are associated with the role, as well as methods for managing those permissions. For example, the `add_permission` method can be used to add a new permission to the role, and the `has_permission` method can be used to check if the role has a specific permission.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible framework for managing user authentication and authorization in the opshin project.

By setting the context to `Load()`, we ensure that the target is only evaluated once. \n\nNext, the method creates a new `Assign` node, with the original target replaced by the modified copy. The value of the assignment is a `BinOp` node, which represents the binary operation being performed in the augmented assignment.

If it is not the `dataclass` function, it checks if the function signature expects a single argument of `UnitInstanceType` and if the function call has no arguments. If both of these conditions are true, it appends a new argument to the `args` attribute of the `node` parameter that is a `TypedConstant` instance with a value of `None` and a type of `UnitInstanceType`. This ensures that the function call is updated to pass in a `Unit` instance.\n\nOverall, this code is useful for ensuring that all functions in the project have a consistent signature and that function calls are made with the correct arguments. It can be used as a part of a larger project to ensure that all functions are standardized and that function calls are made correctly. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom opshin import RewriteZeroAry\n\n# create an instance of the RewriteZeroAry class\nrewriter = RewriteZeroAry()\n\n# apply the rewriter to a function definition\ndef my_function():\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\nrewriter.visit_FunctionDef(my_function)\n\n# apply the rewriter to a function call\nmy_function()\nrewriter.visit_Call(my_function)\n```",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code rewrites functions that don't take arguments into functions that take a singleton None argument and rewrites function calls without arguments to calls that pass Unit into the function, except for the dataclass call.\n\n2. What is the `RewriteZeroAry` class doing?\n- The `RewriteZeroAry` class is a subclass of `CompilingNodeTransformer` that visits `FunctionDef` and `Call` nodes and rewrites them as described in the code's purpose.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `NoneInstanceType` and `UnitInstanceType` classes?\n- `NoneInstanceType` is used to represent the type of `None`, while `UnitInstanceType` is used to represent the type of the `Unit` object, which is used as a placeholder for function calls that don't take any arguments."

These transformations and checks are implemented using classes that inherit from the `CompilingNodeTransformer` class, which provides a framework for modifying and transforming Python abstract syntax trees (ASTs).\n\nFor example, the `RewriteAugAssign` class rewrites all occurrences of augmented assignments into normal assignments, simplifying the logic of the code that operates on these assignments. The `RewriteForbiddenOverwrites` class prevents certain variable names from being overwritten, which is useful in projects that make use of type annotations or custom decorators.\n\nThe `RewriteImportDataclasses` and `RewriteImportTyping` classes ensure that the `dataclasses` and `typing` modules are imported and used correctly in a Python program, which is important for maintaining code quality and consistency. The `RewriteInjectBuiltinsConstr` class injects constructors for built-in types that double function as type annotations, ensuring that classes are not reassigned without a constructor.\n\nHere's an example of how the `RewriteAugAssign` class can be used:\n\n```python\nfrom ast import parse\nfrom opshin.rewrite_aug_assign import RewriteAugAssign\n\ncode = \"x += 1\"\ntree = parse(code)\nrewriter = RewriteAugAssign()\nnew_tree = rewriter.visit(tree)\nprint(new_tree)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nModule(body=[Assign(targets=[Name(id='x', ctx=Store())], value=BinOp(left=Name(id='x', ctx=Load()), op=Add(), right=Constant(value=1)))])\n```\n\nIn summary, the code in the `.autodoc/docs/json/opshin/rewrite` folder provides a set of tools for transforming and checking Python code to ensure proper usage of imports, type annotations, and assignments. These tools can be used as part of a larger code analysis or linting tool to enforce best practices and maintain code quality and consistency.",

The module contains three functions: gcd, sign, and unsigned_int_from_bytes_big.\n\nThe gcd function takes two integer arguments, a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd.

  "summary": "The `opshin` project provides a framework for compiling and evaluating Python programs into UPLC (Unspent Transaction Output Payable Contract) code, which is useful for developers who want to write smart contracts for the Cardano blockchain in Python. The project is organized into several modules and subfolders, each focusing on specific functionality, such as code compilation, optimization, type inference, and handling tokens at addresses.\n\nFor example, the `compiler.py` module is responsible for compiling a Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into UPLC/Pluto-like code. It does so by implementing a series of transformations and optimizations on the input AST, ultimately producing a compiled program that can be executed in the UPLC/Pluto environment.\n\n```python\nfrom ast import parse\nfrom opshin import compile\n\nsource_code = \"\"\"\ndef validator(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a + b\n\"\"\"\n\nast_tree = parse(source_code)\ncompiled_program = compile(ast_tree, force_three_params=False, validator_function_name=\"validator\")\n```\n\nThe `type_inference.py` module performs aggressive type inference on Python code, based on the work of Aycock [1]. The purpose of this type inference is to resolve overloaded functions when translating Python into UPLC, where there is no dynamic type checking. Additionally, it provides an extra layer of security for the Smart Contract by checking type correctness.\n\n```python\nfrom .type_inference import typed_ast\nimport ast\n\nsource_code = \"\"\"\nclass MyClass:\n    CONSTR_ID: int = 1\n    attribute: int\n\"\"\"\n\ntree = ast.parse(source_code)\ntyped_tree = typed_ast(tree)\n```\n\nThe `prelude.py` module defines a set of optimized methods for handling tokens at addresses in the opshin project. These functions are used to handle tokens at addresses in the opshin project, such as checking if a user has enough unlocked tokens to perform a transaction or validating the spending of a UTxO.\n\nThe `__main__.py` module provides a command-line interface for compiling and evaluating Python programs into UPLC code. This is useful for developers who want to write smart contracts for the Cardano blockchain in Python, which is a more familiar language for many developers than the low-level UPLC language.\n\n```\n$ python opshin.py eval my_contract.py 42 \"hello world\"\nStarting execution\n------------------\nHello, world!
