# OpShin Bug Bounty Program

## Introduction

Welcome to our Bug Bounty Program, an initiative designed to encourage and reward contributions from our community towards improving the security and functionality of our project. By identifying and reporting vulnerabilities, and suggesting new features or enhancements, participants can help us maintain the integrity and innovation of our platform. Our program is open to anyone with the skills to detect issues or propose valuable updates. By participating, you not only contribute to the project's success but also have the opportunity to earn rewards.

## Scope of the Program

The scope of our Bug Bounty Program includes, but is not limited to:

- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Identifying potential security threats that could compromise the privacy, integrity, or availability of our project's data or infrastructure.
- **Functional Bugs:** Finding and reporting bugs that affect the functionality of our platform, leading to incorrect behavior or results.
- **Feature Suggestions:** Proposing new features or enhancements that can add value to the current functionalities or user experience of our platform.

Discovered issues with the codebase and feature suggestions will be tagged with prices directly in the [GitHub repository issues](https://github.com/opshin/opshin/issues). These tags represent the monetary value of each task, based on its complexity and impact.
